# LaTeX & OCR

For LaTeX to work in SMA  you need MiKTeX and mathpix OCR.



## How to use OCR

## How to use LateX

### Basic functionality 

1. You **OCR** text with <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>Left/Right Mouse button</kbd> *(right mouse = force selection)*
2. An editor window will pop up. Here you can edit the equation as you wish.
3. After confirming that everything looks okay, you press OK and <kbd>ALT+X</kbd> 

LateX equation is extracted into your SM collection which will look for example like this 

![](content\images\LateX\latex-image-exampleformula.png)

You press <kbd>CTRL+ALT+L</kbd></kbd> and it is turned into: 

$ 8 y ^ { 2 } - 7 y + 4 $

Here is a <a href="content/videos/plugin-latex/latex-complex-extract-result.mp4?raw=true">link to the video</a> instead.</p> </video>
Note that you can integrate text with LateX. This is useful especially when these two are inline together.


## Installation: LateX

1. Download MiKTeX https://miktex.org/download

2. <font size=5 color=red>Install with these options</font>
	
	2.1. **Install MiKTeX for anyone who uses this computer (all users)**
	
	2.2. **Install missing packages on-the-fly: Yes**

3. Add the miktex bin folder to your PATH environment variables

  3.1 Search "Enviroment variables" in windows

  3.2 Click "Enviroment Variables"

   3.3. Find variable called "Path" under **System variables** and click "Edit". Create New value and insert path for miktex (usually *C:\Program Files\MikTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\64\*)

4. Open settings in <u>MiKTeX console</u> and make sure the packages can be downloaded on the fly

5. Your "Directories" should be configured like  [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supermemo/Documentation/master/docs/sma/content/images/MiktexSetup/miktex-directories.png)

Once this is done, you're ready to move onto [How to use LateX](https://sma.supermemo.wiki//sma/#/plugins-LaTeX?id=how-to-use-latex)


## Installation: OCR

1. You need mathpix account https://mathpix.com/ocr

2. Sign-up requires credit card, the costs are insignificant - practically free (unless you do thousands of request per month)

3. After you have signed in, locate: (1) **app_id** and (2) **app_key**. These you need to insert in SMAÂ´s PDF settings:

4. You can access PDF settings via SMA icon (the image), or CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+O

5. app_id and app_key are inserted under "MathPix App name" and "MathPix App key"
