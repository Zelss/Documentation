## Why & How ?

#### Why should you backup ?

!> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Your collection is precious**. If you are using SuperMemo, you will likely be pouring days, weeks or months of your life in building it. Don't let it all go to waste. **Having frequent backups is vital**.

Do you care about your health ? Would you take a gamble on your life and forfeit your health insurance ? If your answer is no, then keep reading.

Computer glitches can happen at any time. It is precisely because we cannot anticipate them, that we take measures to mitigate their potential damage.

#### Proposed strategy

The strategy that we suggest attempts to strike a **balance between robustness and ease of use**. This is not a foolproof method, but it should be robust enough that you do not lose more than a single session of SuperMemo.

?> As importantly, it shouldn't take you more than **a few seconds** to commit your hard work to **safety**.

We are going to implement two layers of safety:
1. *Local backups*: Frequent (15 minutes), cheap (disk size), without interruption (you can use SuperMemo concurrently).
2. *Internet backups*: On-demand (after every session), long-term storage (unlimited).

As of the moment of writing this guide (2020/02), this solution is **free** (as in free beer, and in freedom). As an added bonus, you will also be able to **synchronize your collection** between computers.

## Step-by-step guide

### Local backups: BitShelter

[BitShelter](https://github.com/alexis-/BitShelter) *(a.k.a. SuperMemo Backup)* is a software that keeps a version history of your files. It is similar to the Ctrl+Z feature of text editors, only for files.

##### I) (*Optional*) Create a partition for your SuperMemo collections

For easier management of your files, and to save space for the frequent snapshots (more on these later), we recommend creating a partition dedicated to your SuperMemo collection.

?> If you don't know how to create a partition in Windows, you can [follow this guide](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-to-make-partitions-windows-10,36643.html).

You should obtain a layout similar to this one (it is fine if you only have one disk, instead of two as in this example):
![SuperMemo partition](content/images/backup-setup/computer-management-disks.png)

##### II) Install & Configuration

###### Installing BitShelter

1. Download and install [the latest version](https://github.com/alexis-/BitShelter/releases) of *BitShelter*
2. Start **BitShelter Agent** from the Windows Start menu
3. Double-click on the [**Tray Icon**](https://github.com/alexis-/BitShelter/raw/master/Resources/BitShelter.Agent_TrayIcon.png): ![](https://github.com/alexis-/BitShelter/raw/master/Resources/BitShelter_Icon.png)

###### Enabling Windows snapshots feature

> Take note of the Drive Letter which contains your SuperMemo collection. If you only have one disk in your computer, it should be C:\\

?> **In this example, the SuperMemo collection Drive Letter is E:\**

1. In the [Main Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexis-/BitShelter/master/Resources/BitShelter.Agent_Rules.png), click on the <kbd>**Add Schedule**</kbd> button
2. Click on <kbd>**Enable other Drive(s)**</kbd> in the [General tab](https://github.com/alexis-/BitShelter/raw/master/Resources/BitShelter.Agent_General.png)
3. Select the SuperMemo drive **(E:\\)** in the [System Protection dialog](https://github.com/alexis-/BitShelter/raw/master/Resources/SystemPropertiesProtection_2018-05-05_13-10-18.png) and click on <kbd>**Configure**</kbd>
4. In the [new dialog](https://github.com/alexis-/BitShelter/raw/master/Resources/SystemPropertiesProtection_2018-05-05_13-10-22.png) click on <kbd>**Turn on protection**</kbd>, select at least 2GB of desired reserved space(\*) for Snapshots, then press <kbd>**OK**</kbd>
5. Back in the [General tab](https://github.com/alexis-/BitShelter/raw/master/Resources/BitShelter.Agent_General.png), click on <kbd>**Raise limit**</kbd>, and set the new limit to **512**

\*: *If you chose not to create a partition dedicated to SuperMemo, the reserved space will be used up by all the other modifications written to your partition. You should consequently increase the reserved space.*

###### Creating snapshot rules in BitShelter

1. Frequent snapshots (15 min)
  1. Click on the <kbd>**Add Schedule**</kbd> button
    * Select the SuperMemo **Drive letter (E:\\)**
    * Set **Lifetime** to *1 Day*
  2. Click on the <kbd>**Schedule**</kbd> **tab** and fill [the following values](content/images/backup-setup/bitshelter-15min-schedule.png ':ignore')
    * **Occurs every**: *15 minutes*
	* **Frequency**: *Daily*
	* **Recurs every**: *1 day(s)*
	* **End on**: *Never*
  3. Press the **Create** button
2. Daily snapshots
  1. Click on the <kbd>**Add Schedule**</kbd> button
    * Select the SuperMemo **Drive letter (E:\\)**
    * Set **Lifetime** to *6 Month*
  2. Click on the <kbd>**Schedule**</kbd> **tab** and fill [the following values](content/images/backup-setup/bitshelter-daily-schedule.png ':ignore')
    * **Occurs once at**: *08::00::00 (or whenever your computer is running)*
	* **Frequency**: *Daily*
	* **Recurs every**: *1 day(s)*
	* **End on**: *Never*
  3. Press the **Create** button

###### You are done... Almost !

!> It is highly recommended that you **make sure everything is working as inteded**. [Verify the snapshots](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/11130/restore-previous-versions-of-files-in-every-edition-of-windows-7/) are properly created on your SuperMemo Drive **(E:\\)**

Your BitShelter settings should look similar to the following configuration:

## Testimonies

> üí¨ **Luke Avedon**: ‚Äú*Back up your collection.  I'm ashamed to admit I used to never back up my collection.  Once while running a quick, 'repair collection' I lost power.  An entire section of my knowledge tree was mangled forever.  All the references changed to strange, incomprehensible characters.  Now I know better.  I automatically back up to two local hard drives, and three cloud drives each day.*‚Äù

> üí¨ **Nour**: ‚Äú*Well, I'm a bit new to SM and although I was warned, I did not understand the gravity of the warnings. Back-up your collection. Since I'm new, I don't understand a lot of the issues, but I know I didn't do anything to provoke them, and yet the combination of SM and my virtual machine had corrupted and misplaced files and needed to be repaired ‚Äì with the repairs yielding some unwanted adjustments to my collection. Of course, if all your final prep is on SM, you'd be having heart palpitations at the thought of your collection getting messed up, I know I was. Sufficed to say lesson learned. The hard way, but learned never-the-less.*‚Äù
